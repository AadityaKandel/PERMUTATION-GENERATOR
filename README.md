# PERMUTATION-GENERATOR
Say hello to my new permutation generator which generates permutations of any given array. Thanks to the lexicographical order, I was able to create a C program that can generate permutations. The logic is entirely done but some extra features may be added on the next updates. For now, this is more than enough.

# OBJECTIVE: Stay under the syllabus of Class XII Computer Book
- Extra Codes Used
  - Malloc: was a must since everytime the program ran, one of the fixed variable called "indexes" was generating bullshit value even though the logic was correct
  - Memcmp: was a must since there seemed no other way to do so. Either I have to create one extra unnecessary loop which checks it every time or I can use this single
            line of code. Hence, I used this.
- All other codes are directly from the syllabus
