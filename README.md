# PERMUTATION-GENERATOR
Say hello to my new permutation generator which generates permutations of any given array. Thanks to the lexicographical order, I was able to create a C program that can generate permutations. The logic is entirely done but some extra features may be added on the next updates. For now, this is more than enough.
